# Morse-Decryption

First project for professional portfolio proposed by Bootcamp 100 days of code (Python) on day 82.

This project does not have a step-by-step guide or solution.
I made the decision to use Pandas and OOP to create a solution.
I took the liberty of also creating the function to create morse code decryption for text in addition to encoding the text in morse.
I found it a bit simple for a professional project, however it was good to remember some concepts and features that are lost due to lack of practice.
In the future I will create a graphical interface with Tkinter.
